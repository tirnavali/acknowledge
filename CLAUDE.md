# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start PostgreSQL database (requires Docker Desktop running)
docker-compose up -d

# Run the application
python app.py

# Initialize/reset database schema
python init_db.py
```

There are no test or lint commands configured in this project.

## Installing Dependencies

Three requirements files exist for different hardware:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt           # CPU / MPS (default)
pip install -r requirements-cuda.txt      # NVIDIA CUDA (uses --index-url for torch)
pip install -r requirements-mps.txt       # Apple Silicon MPS
```

## AI Model Setup (Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct)

On corporate networks with MITM SSL proxies, download the model manually before first run:

```bash
python download_model.py   # downloads ~3 GB to ./models/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct
```

If the local copy exists at `./models/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct` or `./src/models/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`, `CaptionService` loads from disk automatically; otherwise it falls back to HuggingFace Hub. Set `HF_TOKEN` in `.env` for authenticated hub access.

## Architecture Overview

**Acknowledge** is a PySide6 desktop application for media archiving, IPTC metadata editing, face detection, and AI-powered captioning, backed by PostgreSQL with pgvector.

### Layer Structure

```
UI Layer         → app.py (MainWindow), root-level widget files
Service Layer    → src/services/  (business logic, orchestration)
Repository Layer → src/repositories/  (data access via SQLAlchemy)
Domain Layer     → src/domain/entities/, src/domain/value_objects/
ORM Models       → src/models.py  (SQLAlchemy table definitions)
DB Setup         → src/database.py  (engine, session, connection management)
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**ApplicationService as Facade** — `src/services/application_service.py` is the single entry point from `app.py` into all business logic. It instantiates and wires all repositories and services via constructor injection. `MainWindow` holds one `ApplicationService` instance and calls through it.

**Dual Metadata Persistence** — IPTC metadata is stored in two places simultaneously: written directly to image files via `iptcinfo3` and persisted in the `medias` table. On gallery load, the DB copy takes priority for speed; `_write_iptc_to_file()` in `app.py` handles file-side writes.

**Deferred Background Loading** — Gallery items pre-populate metadata from the DB immediately, then enqueue heavy file I/O (thumbnail generation, file-based IPTC) as background tasks via Qt thread pools.

**Face Detection Pipeline** — `FaceAnalysisService` (`src/services/face_analysis_service.py`) uses insightface `buffalo_l` model (ArcFace, 512-dim embeddings). Detection results are stored in `face_detections` table (normalised bbox + `Vector(512)` embedding) and linked to `Person` records via `media_persons`. Bounding boxes rendered via `FaceOverlayWidget`. `medias.face_encoding` (`Vector(128)`) is a legacy unused column.

**Caption Service** — `CaptionService` (`src/services/caption_service.py`) is a singleton wrapping Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. It loads lazily on first call, auto-selects CUDA > MPS > CPU, and outputs Turkish-only JSON (`caption_tr`, `tags_tr`). Images are pre-resized to 768 px on the longest side before inference. `caption_en` / `tags_en` columns exist in the DB but are currently left empty. All caption work runs in `QThread` workers (`CaptionTabWidget`) to keep the UI responsive.

**Search/Filter** — `GallerySearchProxyModel` (in `gallery_item_model.py`) wraps the gallery model as a Qt proxy model, enabling keyword filtering and relevance-based sorting without reloading from DB.

**Path Storage** — `src/utils/path_util.py` stores file paths in the DB as relative paths from the project root (forward slashes). `to_db_path()` converts absolute → relative on write; `from_db_path()` converts back on read. Absolute legacy paths are handled as a fallback. Always use these helpers when reading/writing `file_path` columns to avoid cross-machine path breakage.

**Thumbnail Caching** — Thumbnails are pre-generated into a `.thumbnails/` subdirectory inside each event's vault folder (e.g. `vault/EventName/.thumbnails/photo.jpg.thumb.jpg`). Generated during import in `EventService.create_and_import_event()` and lazily on first gallery load via `GalleryItemModel.generate_pixmap()`.

**Corporate SSL Bypass** — Both `FaceAnalysisService` and `CaptionService` patch `requests.Session` at import time to disable SSL verification globally. This is intentional for environments with MITM proxies. Do not remove these patches.

### Database

PostgreSQL + pgvector. Connection configured via `.env`:
```
DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME
MEDIA_VAULT_PATH
```

Schema is managed by `init_db.py` using `Base.metadata.create_all()` plus dynamic `ALTER TABLE` for IPTC columns. No migration framework is used.

Key tables: `events` → `medias` (cascade delete) ↔ `persons` (via `media_persons`), `face_detections`.

### UI Structure

`MainWindow` in `app.py` owns the full layout:
- Left panel: event list (`QScrollArea` of `EventCardWidget` items) — `event_card_widget.py`
- Center: gallery grid (`QListView` + `GalleryItemModel`) — `gallery_item_model.py`
- Right panel: IPTC metadata form + face detection controls
- Bottom: `SingleViewWidget` for full-size image with `FaceOverlayWidget` overlay — `single_view_widget.py`, `face_overlay_widget.py`
- Tab widget: Events tab (main view) + Settings tab + Caption (Altyazı) tab

Caption tab (`caption_tab_widget.py`) hosts single-image and batch captioning modes with `ModelLoadWorker`, `CaptionWorker`, and `BatchCaptionWorker` QThread subclasses. After each run it attempts to persist results to the DB via `MediaService.save_captions()`. Batch results are also auto-saved to `batch_results.json` in the working directory.

`CaptionStatsWidget` (`caption_stats_widget.py`) is a separate stats panel showing the last 5 inference runs and overall averages. It receives `CaptionResult` objects via the `stats_updated` signal on `CaptionTabWidget`.

Event import dialog is `add_event_window.py`. `BatchFaceWorker` (QThread subclass in `app.py`) runs face detection + auto-person-matching in the background.
